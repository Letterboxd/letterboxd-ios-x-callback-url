## x-callback parameters

**__This is optional but recommended for better user experience__**

x-callback-url defines several parameters with specific purposes, all of which are optional. These parameters should be passed as query args in the URL, in the format `key1=value1&key2=value2`. All values should be URL encoded strings.

- **x-success** : URL to open on completion of the requested action. If not provided, the user will stay in the Letterboxd app after the action is successfully completed.

- **x-cancel** : URL to open if the requested action is cancelled by the user. If not provided, the user will stay in the Letterboxd app after the action is cancelled.

- **x-error** : URL to open if the requested action generates an error or failed to complete. In such case, Letterboxd app will report the failure to the user, and return to the source app. If not present, user will stay in the Letterboxd app.

## Examples

The following are a few example uses of the URL scheme.
